//Docker
Docker Images:
-> Images are blueprints for the containers
    -> Images includes:
        -> Runtime environment
        -> Application code
        -> any dependencies
        -> Extra Configuration (e.g. env variables)
        -> Commands 
            ..etc
    -> Node.js, React.js, mongodb, mysql,python ..etc are images.

Docker Containers:
-> Containers are runnable instances of the Images
-> Container can runs application
-> Containers are also known as isolated process because they run independently to any other process
-> That is application is run on its own box without needing anything of the system
-> Docker is just like virtual machine
-> when we bundle together all the images it becomes a container
-> images are made up of several layers
-> parent image: it is initial layer of the application which includes os or sometimes runtime env.
-> dockerHub: online repository of docker where you can find lots of images. Just like react, node images ..etc
-> dockerHub is like github for docker

==> Commands
-> docker pull node: used to pull node image in docker
    if we don't provide the version of images, default it will pull latest version
-> To Build a docker image
    docker build -t set_image_name .
    here .-> is relative path where Dockerfile is exists
